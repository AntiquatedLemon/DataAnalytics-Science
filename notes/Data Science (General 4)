Math
which procedures to use and why
know what to do when things dont work right
some are easier and quicker by hand

Algebra, Linear (matrix) algebra, systems of equations
Calculus, Big O, Probability, Bayes

Foundational:
    no notes for me, learned this
    though might want to break my linear algebra book back out for a quick review

Calculus:
    Why?
        basis of a lot of calculations
            least squares regression
            probability distributions
        changes over time
        min/max of functions in optimizing
    Types
        differential (rates of change at specific time)
        integral (given rate of change, quantity at specific time)
    Example: optimize sales and revenue

Big O:
    rate of growth for calculation as the number of elements grows
    functions vary in speed, and can be inconsistent
    just be aware of the demands
    
Probability:
    what are the odds
    range 0-1
    conditional probability P(A|B): probability of A, given B is true
    Type I and II errors in hypothesis testing
    Bayes

Statistics:
    Descriptive: 
    Inferential: 
    Hypothesis testing:
    Estimation: 
    
    Choices:
        estimators
        measures of fit
        feature selection
        common problems
        model validation
        
Exploratory Approach:
    Graphical - use graphs to get best overaall impression
        bar charts, histograms, scatterplots
        why graphical first?
            get a feel for the data
            check assumptions, ensure that it matches the requirements for the procedure
            check for anomalies, outliers, unusual distributions, errors
            unusual elements might need a deeper analysis or different angle 
        options to do so
            code based: R, Python, JavaScript (d3.js)
            apps: Tableau, Qlik, Excel

        Distributions:
            Univariate:
                bar chart: 
                    categories
                    easy to read
                    descending
                    horizontal (makes labels easier to read)
                box plot: 
                    quantitative vairables
                    show quartile values and outliers
                    many variables side by side if the scales are roughly similar
                histogram: 
                    quantitative
                    shape of distribution
                    compare many
             Bivariate:
                 group bar charts or box plots: 
                     see association of category and outcome
                 scatterplot: 
                     two quantitative variables
                     see linearity, outliers
                     strength of association     
             Multivariate:
                 3D graph?
                     no lol, these are difficult to read and hurts my eyes
                     need to be in motion
                     might be useful for seeing 3D clustering
                 instead: matrix of graphs
                     many quantitative variables
                     use markers for groups
                     clearer than 3D
            
    Numerical - greater precision, try variations of data and methods
        transform data, empirical estimates, robust methods

        Robust Statistics:
            stable estimates - roughly the same despite the inflections
            less affected by outliers, skewness, kurtosis, etc
        Resampling:
        
        Transforming:
