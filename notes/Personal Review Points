Categories and their explanations:
- No Need at All
    exactly as stated
    technologies: R, SQL, Python, Excel, Tableau
- Fast Fill In/Up
    known by "this isn't hard, I still remember this with relatively certainty)
    could also just not take that long to learn as it's not complex
- Brush Up A
    known by needing only really a conceptual review to remind myself of how things work
- Brush Up B
    BUA + coding as well, memory is a little lacking but may come back to me quickly
- Understood, Never Coded
    conceptually there but I have never personally coded
    will take a lot more effort on my part to learn the syntax for it
- I'm sorry, huh?
    pardon my ignorance but what did you just say to me? (read: I don't know this at all)
    
    
    
No Need at all
    algebra
    systems of equations
Fast Fill In/Up
    general stats
    REGEX
    learn API pulls and data scraping in R and Python
    running scripts
    pros and cons of R or Python for projects (just for my own edification)
Brush Up A
    linear algebra
        thoughts: probably not too bad since I still remembered how to do some simpler ones
    calculus
        thoughts:
            linear algebra coincided with calc 3 for me so assume I need to go that far
            but just speed through from calc 1 to 3 to be very sure I got it
Brush Up B
    - estimators, measures of fit, feature selection, validation techniques
Understood, Never Coded
- time series analysis
I'm sorry, huh?

Consider Learning:
- technologies: RapidMiner, KNIME, Hadoop, SAS, Spark? ... maybe add PHP?


General Goal:if I can do it in one of my main 3 (R, Python, Excel), I want to be able to do it in the other two, even if it is rather difficult
